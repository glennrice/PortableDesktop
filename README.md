# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

*  A wrapper script for PortableApps.com & VeraCrypt to take apps, docs and work environment to any computer that you might need to work on.

We all often need to work with some of our own apps and data but often can't, or don't want to install them on an employer's computer - especially if it is sometimes shared by other people. With this script you can have your own environment off of a USB drive which is encrypted when not in use.

* Version... Alpha, alpha, alpha! Definitely consider this "pre-release" as it only ever been for my own use although I still periodically update  and tidy this up. If anyone else starts using it it may encourage me to update it more.
